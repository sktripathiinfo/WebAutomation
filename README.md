Web Automation Project
Welcome to the Web Automation Project repository! This project showcases my journey in mastering core concepts of Selenium with Python, applying Git commands for version control, and integrating the pytest framework for robust testing. The goal is to automate web applications efficiently and ensure high-quality software delivery.

Features
Selenium WebDriver: Utilized to interact with web elements, automate browser actions, and validate web application functionality.
Python: Implemented core Python concepts to create clean, efficient, and maintainable test scripts.
Git: Leveraged Git for version control, managing changes, and collaborating on code.
Pytest: Integrated the pytest framework for organizing, executing, and reporting test cases.
Technologies Used
Python: For writing test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: For automating web browsers.
Pytest: For testing and reporting.
Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
